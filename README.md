## Introduction
COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a respiratory illness that emerged in late 2019 and led to a global pandemic.  Approximately 1.8 to 2 million people all over the world died due to COVID-19 in 2020. Vaccination is a crucial tool in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic that began in late 2020. It generally requires multiple doses to achieve optimal protection. Though the risk factor of this pandemic is now under control, tracking of COVID-19 vaccination needs to be emphasized to stop this pandemic fully and for future research.
## Aim
The main goal of this project is to get the overall COVID-19 vaccination data analysis using Tableau.

## Data
The dataset I used in this project is from [ourworldindata](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?lid=33450) 

## Questions of Interest
1. KPI 1- How many people are partially vaccinated?
2. KPI 2- How many people are fully vaccinated?
3. KPI 3- How many people are not vaccinated?
4. How many people are fully and partially vaccinated across different countries and continents?
5. How many people are fully/partially vaccinated across different countries and continents?
6. How does the GDP per capita affect the vaccination rate?
