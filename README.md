## Introduction
COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a respiratory illness that emerged in late 2019 and led to a global pandemic.  Approximately 1.8 to 2 million people all over the world died due to COVID-19 in 2020. Vaccination is a crucial tool in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic that began in late 2020. It generally requires multiple doses to achieve optimal protection. Though the risk factor of this pandemic is now under control, tracking of COVID-19 vaccination needs to be emphasized to stop this pandemic fully and for future research.
## Goal
The main goal of this project is to get the data analysis for overall COVID-19 vaccination status using Tableau public.

## Data
The dataset I used in this project is from [ourworldindata](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?lid=33450). 

## Questions of Interest
1. KPI 1- How many people are partially vaccinated?
2. KPI 2- How many people are fully vaccinated?
3. KPI 3- How many people are not vaccinated?
4. How many people are fully and partially vaccinated across different countries and continents?
5. How many people are fully/partially vaccinated across different countries and continents?
6. How does the GDP per capita affect the vaccination rate?

## Results
I have created dashboard considering the question of interest. I have utilized some features in tableau to make the dashboard such as calculated column, bar chart, map, trend line. Here is the dashboard:

## Key Insights
Here are some important insight that presented in this dashboard:
1. A large Number of people are fully/partially vaccinated.
2. Till now 30% people are not vaccinated yet and 70% people are either partially or fully vaccinated over the world.
3. The maximum number of people vaccinated is in North America, South America and Asia; the medium range of people vaccinated is in Europe and lowest range of vaccination belongs to Africa.
4. Maximum GDP per capita is logarithmically increased with the number of vaccination.
